When the link is opened it seems like a regular link nothing suspicious

But, the title of challenge was clearly indicating to look for robots.txt

On looking at that we [get](robots.txt)

Now, the question came up what other .txt files are generally available or what other response could be after modifying user-agent

After lots of fruitless strokes, it struck could there be file for humans like it's for robots

And, there it was with [flag](humans.txt)
